Before selecting the payment option that is best for you, please review McMaster's payment deadlines.\n\nOption 1: Pay in full\nFull payment is due by the 25th of the first month of each term (September, January, May). Full payment needs to be received by the due dates for each term in order to avoid monthly interest charges or late payment fees. Please note: additional fees and fines may be added to your student account at any time during the term, i.e. library fines, missed appointments, replaced ID cards, etc. Regularly review your Account Summary on Mosaic to ensure all charges are as expected, all payments made to the school have been received and all balances are paid in full before the start of the next term.\n\nOption 2: Payment plan\nThe university’s payment deadlines will remain, however, you can now choose to pay your fees in four monthly payments per term. The plan enrolment dates vary from semester to semester. Even if you have already enrolled in a current term’s payment plan, you will still need to re-apply for the payment plan option for the next term during those dates.

It may take a few business days for your profile to connect to AwardSpring after applying on OUAC and logging into Mosaic for the first time. Log in to AwardSpring using your MacID and password.\n\nStep 2: Fill out the General Application\nThe General Application on AwardSpring asks for important information to match you with awards for which you are eligible. We blanked out some sections that you do not need, so feel free to skip them.\n\nStep 3: Complete follow-ups to finish your award applications\nOnce you have submitted your General Application, you will find “Follow-Ups” on the Dashboard tab. Follow-ups are extra criteria like essays, referrals, etc. Complete the follow-ups for each award to apply for that award. In the Scholarships section, you can view all your submitted applications and any automatic awards. The Applied in AwardSpring status means that your application was received by the deadline and is eligible for further review.\n\nAfter you apply:\nMake sure you add “mcmaster.awardspring.ca” to your Safe Senders List on your McMaster email account. Regularly check your McMaster email account for feedback on your award applications. Successful applicants will be notified of an award offer via their McMaster email. An award offer depends on an offer(s) of admission and may have one or more award conditions attached (e.g. enrolment in a specific program). Award offers will be displayed in the Mosaic applicant portal."

Online registration deadlines are as follows: McMaster Continuing Education has implemented a late registration allowance for all course formats that run at least 11 weeks. We will permit enrolment up until 2 weeks after the course start date. Example: Course start date September 15, 2021; enrolment deadline September 29, 2021, 11:59 p.m. EST. Please note registering after the course start date may delay course access and does not permit exceptions to coursework due dates, late textbook purchases, or the refund policy. Some exceptions may apply. Late enrolment is not permitted in courses that are 10 weeks or less. Virtual Classroom Essentials workshops permit enrolment up until three days prior to the start date (unless otherwise indicated). Example: Start date September 14, enrolment deadline September 11, 11:59 p.m. EST. Deadlines vary for professional development courses and condensed/fast-track courses. Once enrolment closes, or courses are full, no further enrolments will be accepted. Please note enrolling after the course start date may delay course access and does not permit exceptions to coursework due dates, late textbook purchases, or the refund policy."
